            <p>The Hawaii National Park is in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hawaii" target="_blank">Hawaii</a> (obviously). and the park contains two major volcanoes including the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mauna+loa" target="_blank">Mauna Loa</a> (aka the largest active volcano in the world) and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kilauea" target="_blank">Kilauea</a> (the most active volcano in the world). The national park is nearly 88,000 hectares, large enough to protect the important geological features of the place. The park includes a problem with invasive species. The invaders can hurt the park's rare plants/animals.<br><br>

            Hawaii Volcano National Park was made mostly by volcanic activity. Magma rises from deep inside of the Earth, and comes out through volcanoes. When the lava cools and dries it builds up land and creates volcanic mountains. The Hawaiian Islands were created from lots of volcanoes â€” they're a trail of volcanic eruptions.<br><br>

            The National Park has amazing beauty like lava flows, huge volcanic craters, and forests that attract visitors and photographers from across the world. The park is also important to Native Hawaiian culture. The volcano goddess "Pele" is believed to live there, and the land is full of ancient stories, legends, and sacred sites. Also, the park brings in tourists, which supports local businesses like hotels, restaurants, and tour guides.</p>
